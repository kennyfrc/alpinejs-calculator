# Alpine.js Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built using Alpine.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator.
- `calculator.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for the calculator operations.
- `styles.css`: This CSS file contains the styles for the calculator.

## Usage

To use this calculator, you can serve the files using a simple HTTP server. For example, if you have Python installed, you can use the following command, using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, you can open the calculator in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/`.

Alternatively, you can also use other one-liner HTTP servers through this link: [https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).
